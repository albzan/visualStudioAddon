## Features
fixes in more detail:

*	fixes to intelliSense: unnecessary announcements when using intelliSense were removed to emprove productivity. 
additionaly, positional info of suggested intelliSense item were removed. EG "int 1 of 9" is now reported as "int". however you can get those announcements back by setting some flag to False in the add-on source code. 
in the future, a check box may be dedicated to toggle this option.

*	fixes to different debugging windows: NVDA now reads the content of the wotch, locals,  autos windows.
