#add-on for visual studio

this add-on aims to resolve some issues with visual studio, and to enhance the user experience while using NVDA.

issues which have been fixed so far:
*	Improvements to intelliSense.
*	fixes for accessibility of the debug windows.

The add-on is still under development, so expect more fixes and enhancements.
Your feedback is very important: please let me know if you have suggestions or any thoughts that could help us further improve this add-on.

## Features
Fixes in more detail:

*	fixes to intelliSense: unnecessary announcements when using intelliSense were removed to improve productivity. 
aditionally, positional info of the suggested intelliSense items were removed. EG "int 1 of 9" is now reported as "int". however you can get those announcements back by setting a flag to False in the add-on source code. 
in the future, a check box may be dedicated to toggle this option.

*	fixes to debugging windows: NVDA now reads the content of the wotch, locals, and autos windows.

#important note: 
I need your feedback to know which parts of the UI need further improvements, as well as feedback for the features which were already implemented.
